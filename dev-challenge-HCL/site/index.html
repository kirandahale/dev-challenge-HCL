    <h1>Updating Price Table</h1>
    <div>
        <h3>Approach for Implementation</h3>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Subscribed to /fx/prices to get data for the table.</li>
                <li>Created a fucntion createTable to create table dynamically and update data on DOM when data is getting updated. </li>
                <li>Called createTable function on table data is updated</li>
                <li>Created sparkline data as per calculation mentioned in assignment, draw the sparkline</li>
                <li>Added 30 sec time interval to update sparkline data, so we can show last 30 sec best mid price data.</li>
                <li>Sorted table by Last changed ask price amount column in descending order by javascript sort() method. </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <h3>Frameworks/Liabraries would like to use:</h3>
        <div>
            <p>React JS I would like to use for this solution, because virtual DOM by which we can update only the changed data and for better performance for live update table.
                Bootstrap for table, easy to paginate and manage data at client side.
                In this case, would like to add server side pagination to limit data to push on client side so that DOM would not break after its limit exceeds.
